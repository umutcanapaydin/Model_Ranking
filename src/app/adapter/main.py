"""Minimal FastAPI app providing an L.7 version-stamped /health endpoint.

Seed C.1: day-1 green baseline. The very first commit must include a runnable
app + at least one passing test. Even if the app only serves /health.

Seed L.7: version-stamp the health probe so "which code is live?" is one curl.
  `APP_BUILD` (image tag / git SHA) is set by CI/build (e.g. `ENV APP_BUILD=<tag>`
  in the Dockerfile, or the deploy env). It defaults to "unknown" so dev/test/CI
  on defaults are unaffected. `/health` returns `{status, version, build}` from
  Day 1 (additive fields only -- the liveness `status` contract is untouched).

This module is the seed of `src/<pkg>/adapter/` -- customer-facing API surface
per K.1 boundary discipline (D-001).
